    <h1>Youssef's Takeaway</h1>
    <p>When reading the description of this art piece, the line that struck me was, "Voluntarily or not, nearly all connected devices leak." It is a topic that is passively talked about on a daily, but seeing it put to use is a scary thing. I found it insane how easily information can be intercepeted by some type of middle man approach and showcased like this. This piece really serves as a reminder that we are being watched and listened to at all times. Big companies always take advantage of this, as it is stated in this piece, "Smart TVs overhear conversations, vacuum cleaners map floor plans and upload them to corporate servers, voice assistants are built into routers, gaining access to our browsing patterns, and so on." Sure, it can be put to good use when it comes to advertising, but in the wrong hands or when overheading private messages and data, it can be detremential with alot of things going wrong. This piece also captures any incoming data at all times, showing how from 2020 to now, leaking is a very common predicament. I think this piece is very interesting and I am glad I got to witness it. </p>
