    <h1>Youssef's Experience</h1>
    <p>When reading the description of this art piece, the line that struck me was, "Voluntarily or not, nearly all connected devices leak." It is a topic that is passively talked about on a daily, but seeing it put to use is a scary thing. I found it insane how easily information can be intercepeted by some type of middle man approach and showcased like this. This piece really serves as a reminder that we are being watched and listened to at all times. </p>
