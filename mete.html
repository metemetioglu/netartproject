    <!-- Speaking About Project -->
    <div id="takeawaytext">
        <p> I thought that this project was very interesting because the concepts of AI and data leaks have changed drastically over the past few decades. Things we thought only existed in the movies are now a reality and have even received some upgrades. With all these incredibly convenient advancements comes a brand new wave of data leak possibilities. Such leaks can and will be used by big corporations to target specific audiences and groups based on profiles built around one's interests, wants, and descriptions. This project by Jankauskas and Ecker does an excellent job of showing people how things they say and search in proximity of such devices and on the internet can be uploaded and put to use in whatever way the collector chooses. The addition of the most recent packet slider also adds an extra emphasis on how this data transfer is live and instantaneous, pushing the viewer to further reflect on how quickly a data leak can be utilized by whoever wants it. </p>
